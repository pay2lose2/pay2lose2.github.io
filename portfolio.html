                <p>
                    Currently everything that I program is mainly for fun and doesn't have any real value. However I do plan to release some projects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Steam Lookup Tool:</strong> <span style="color: var(--python1);">Pyt</span><span style="color: var(--python2);">hon</span> tool that uses a parameter <code>?xml=1</code> to display user information in a customtkinter UI with copyable text. I plan to revive and rewrite this project along with doing other stuff related to Steam in the future.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <h1>UI Design</h1>
                <p>
                    Over the past 2 years I have been getting into UI designing. While it's obviously not the greatest work, I am proud of whatever I am doing. Most of my UIs are recreations of other UIs in <span style="color: var(--rbx)">Roblox</span> for robux, but there are also some original ones.
                    <br><br>
                    I do take UI requests and had taken ones before, but please keep in mind that you have to be really patient with me as I am very lazy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
                    <footer>this definitely wasn't a reason why one active project was delayed 3-6 months ago, what are you talking about?</footer>

                    Here's some of my work (right click and open the picture in a tab):
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>My UI</th>

                            </td>
                            <td>
                                Recreation of old Moon client UI.
                                <img src="assets/work/moonreal.png">
                            </td>

                            </td>
                            <td>
                                Recreation of the <a href="dreamclient.xyz">Dream Client</a>'s web interface. Done as a request, got paid but the project went nowhere.
                            </td>

                            <td>
                                Ditto but with some changes (window instead full screen, more tabs, etc). Done as a request, got paid but the project went nowhere.
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                            </td>
                            <td>
                                Recreation of Pulsive Client 5.0. Done with a friend, but went nowhere (even tho we had mostly scripted UI Library). I really like this one and might even be my favorite.
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                            </td>
                            <td>
                                Inspired by Sirius/Rayfield UI Library and was done when I was getting into UI design early on. Definitely one of the good ones.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
