                                Recreation of the <a href="dreamclient.xyz">Dream Client</a>'s web interface. Done as a request, got paid but the project went nowhere.

                                Recreation of Pulsive Client 5.0. Done with a friend, but went nowhere (even tho we had mostly scripted UI Library). I really like this one and might even be my favorite.

                                Inspired by Sirius/Rayfield UI Library and was done when I was getting into UI design early on. Definitely one of the good ones.
