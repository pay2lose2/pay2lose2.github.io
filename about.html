            <br>
            Most of my programming language knowledge comes from pasting from youtube videos and looking at open source projects, since you need to start and learn from <i>somewhere</i>.
            <br><br>
            As of right now I don't know alot of languages, but in my case it's fine since most programs I make are in free time and don't need to be made in more complicated langauges.

            <summary>UI Design</summary>
            <br>
            I began UI designing around 2-3 years ago and so far it's just been recreations of already existing UIs, but I really enjoy doing it and I'm proud of my work! Most of UIs are made in <span style="color: var(--rbx);">Roblox</span>, however I would like to move to other applications in the future like Figma and use my skills somewhere else <span style="font-size: x-small;">(like right now. you're seeing me use it to make this page half-decent with bad user experience 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤑🤑🤑🤑)</span>.

        <details>
            <summary>Gaming</summary>
            <br>
            I regularly play games. I also really like to mod them and mess around in them via tools like macros and lag switches. Sorry :)
            <br><br>
            In most of cases, I just play whatever catches my eyes, like a game that looks interesting or a game that I play for shits and giggles. Despite this, I do have selection of genres that I regularly find myself coming back to:
            <ul>
                <li><b title="Examples: Osu!mania (but regular Osu! is also fine), Quaver, etc." style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">Rhythm Games</b> where you click buttons to beat.</li>
                <li><b title="Examples: Eternal Towers Of Hell, PARKOUR Legacy" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">Parkour/Obby games</b> where you jump over obstacles (shocking).</li>
                <li><b>Car (Racing) Games</b> where you drive into trees and crash into your opp(onent)s 🗣️.</li>
                <li><b>Tower Defense Games</b> where you piss off people by not using their strategy 🔥.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Music</summary>
            <br>
            Just like with games, I normally listen to stuff that doesn't sound like ear bleeding garbage, but I often find myself listening to Rock, Metal, (Synth)Pop and Techno.
        </details>

            <summary>Reverse Engineering (Interested)</summary>
            <br>
            <b>DISCLAIMER: I am not good at reverse engineering.</b>
            <br><br>
            The reason why this is my interest is because I really enjoy seeing how stuff works, like for example how some games or programs work. This really sounds like an awesome thing, but I know that it's not an easy thing to do either (especially once you go deeper). That's why I would want to learn how to do this type of stuff in the future.
