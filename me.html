                <p>
                    As already mentioned, My name is pay2lose. I am from <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">pol</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">and</span> and I like to do dumb shit on the internet. I am a guy.

                    <br><br>
                    This page will explain more about my hobbies, my interests and some stuff I would like to do in the future
                </p>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <h2>
                    Programming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started programming by making <span style="color: var(--rbx)">Roblox</span> games and pasting from open source scripts and projects. If I be honest most of my knowledge is just what I learned from being a paster (because everyone learns from somewhere). 
                    <br> <br>
                    As of right now I mainly program for fun. Majority of my projects don't really have any value, but I like to code them and they help me learn even more so that's what really matters :D
                    <br> <br>
                    Currently I am mostly familiar with these languages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span style="color: var(--luau)">LuaU</span> / <span style="color: var(--rbx)">Roblox</span> <span style="color: var(--lua)">Lua</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="color: var(--python1);">Pyt</span><span style="color: var(--python2);">hon</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In the future I would like to learn more languages that might be more useful, but as of right now these two do just fine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    UI Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I also do UIs! Over the past 2-3 years i've been getting into UI design (mainly on <span style="color: var(--rbx)">Roblox</span>). It's not the greatest work but I'm proud of it! Currently it's just recreations of other existing UIs for some scripts, but I would like to do some regular UIs aswell like inventory or playerlist. Maybe even put those skills outside <span style="color: var(--rbx)">Roblox</span> and actually use them somewhere else! <small>(technically you're seeing them being used right now)</small>
                </p>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    Gaming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If it's not those two, then I play video games! Obviously there's alot of other stuff that I do, but this is probably the most common one. It's mostly just normal gameplay, but I also like to use tools like clumsy (lag switch) and macros to find bugs and glitches in some games.
